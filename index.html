                        My current research focuses on decarbonization solutions through large-scale aggregation of distributed energy resources, battery storage participation in wholesale and 
                        retail electricity markets, and alternative energy resources such as green hydrogen. </p>

            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p> Cong Chen is currently a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering from the Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. She is pursuing a Ph.D. major in Electrical 
                Engineering and two Ph.D. minors in Operation Research and Data Science respectively. She received a B.E. degree from Wuhan University and an M.S. degree from Tsinghua University, both in Electrical 
                Engineering. She was a Ph.D. summer intern in ISO New England in 2021. She was the recipient of the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM) in 2019, the Prize 
                Conference Paper Award at the IEEE PESGM in 2023, and Cornell ECE Outstanding Ph.D. Thesis Award in 2024. She was recognized as the Irwin and Joan Jacobs Scholar at Cornell in 2019, the Engineering 
                and Applied Science Trailblazing Young Researcher at Caltech in 2023, and the Stanford Energy Postdoctoral Fellow in 2024.  </p>
